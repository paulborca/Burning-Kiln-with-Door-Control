# Burning-Kiln-with-Door-Control
The model Burning Kiln with Door control simulates a system of burning chamber as like as it is to be used in industry e. g. as curing oven. The model consists of a heating chamber and a moveable door. In the heating chamber are a festoon bulb, which acts as heating element, as well as a temperature sensor. In simulation the ambient temperature increases by burning festoon bulb which is analogically scaled via temperature sensor. As soon as a set value is reached (burning temperature) it is constantly hold for a certain period (e. g. 25 sec) via two-position controller. After the burning time completion the door can be opened once again. Opening and closing of the door is signed by flashing signal lamp.
